   - [ ] Custom effects
   - [ ] Visual upgrades

2. **Microtransactions**
   - [ ] Payment integration
   - [ ] Currency purchase system
   - [ ] Premium features

## Implementation Status Summary

- **Completed**: 19 items
- **In Progress**: 0 items
- **Not Started**: 27 items
- **Completion Rate**: ~41%

## Next Priority Items

1. Complete the Last Request game types
2. Implement the Gang System features
3. Develop the Shop system
4. Add Free Day features
5. Set up the Proxy system

## Technical Requirements

### Server Requirements

- Support for 30-60 concurrent players
- Paper/Spigot 1.20.x compatibility
- Future compatibility with 1.21+

### Dependencies

- PlaceholderAPI
- Custom weapons plugin/module
- Proxy system for server scaling

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient player role management
- Optimized weapon system
- Scalable map management
- Efficient proxy communication

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**

   - Individual component testing
   - Weapon system testing
   - Role management testing

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Proxy system testing
   - Map loading testing
   - Cross-server communication testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with 60+ players
   - Network latency testing
   - Resource usage monitoring

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**

   - Modular design for easy expansion
   - Plugin API for third-party extensions
   - Version compatibility system

2. **Maintenance**
   - Regular updates for new Minecraft versions
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixing and patches

## Development Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
2. **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks
3. **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks
4. **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks
5. **Phase 5**: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 11-16 weeks

## Risk Assessment

1. **Technical Risks**

   - Weapon system complexity
   - Proxy system reliability
   - Performance with large player counts

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Early prototyping of complex systems
